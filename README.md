# soaptorest
MS to consume a SOAP webservice (XML) and then return a REST (JSON)

We're using the SOAP Webservice: http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?wsdl In order to make sense in the future, there's a WSDL sample in the resource/sample folder. The file is the current WSDL content from the URL.
